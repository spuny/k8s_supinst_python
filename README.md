# Superinst_python
* This bundle of scripts solves and almost automates all what i need to prep my openstack lab


* Master - hopefuly stable version of init scripts

- Just rewriten scripts from bash to python from k8s_supervisor_install

  # Instalation
I made wrapper that sums it all up and install it for you.
You can install it by wrapper or use just chunks of this.

    # Easy install

```
   cd <cloned_repo>
   pip3 isntall -r requirements.txt
   python3 setup.py
```
