# Superinst_python
* This bundle of scripts solves and almost automates all what i need to prep my openstack lab


* Dev - not stable
* Master - hopefuly stable version of init scripts

- Just rewrited scripts from bash to python from k8s_supervisor_install
-- This one is just for learning

  # Instalation
I made wrapper that sums it all up and install it for you.
You can install it by wrapper or use just chunks of this.

    # Easy install
```
   cd <cloned_repo>
   python3 setup.py
```
